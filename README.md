# Air-Pollution-Analysis-Prediction
This repository contains the code and documentation for an air quality analysis project focusing on understanding and predicting air pollution levels in India from 2020 to 2023.

Overview
The project utilizes the R programming language and various data science techniques to preprocess and analyze air pollution data. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize and interpret the distribution of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollutant levels.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and handling missing values.
Feature engineering, including one-hot encoding for city names.
Machine Learning Models:

Trained and evaluated machine learning models, including Random Forest, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, to predict AQI.
Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors model for localized predictions based on carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) levels.
Evaluation Metrics:

Conducted a comparative analysis of different models, assessing metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
Research Contribution:

Contributed insights and findings to a research paper based on the air quality analysis project.
